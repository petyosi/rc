I would like to develop a claude code SEO skill that can test a local site I'm developing for SEO best practices. Gather the details about good SEO practices from the internet and build the skill accordingly. The skill should be able to analyze various aspects of the website, including but not limited to:

- performance metrics (page load speed, mobile-friendliness)
- properly formatted meta tags (title, description, keywords)
- what else?
