# Project Purpose

This is an **RC (Run Commands) configuration repository**. Files in this project are designed to be symlinked to the home directory (`~`) for system-wide use.

**Key points:**

- Files in `claude/skills/` â†’ will be linked to `~/.claude/skills/` (global skills)
- Files in this repo are configuration templates, not project-specific implementations
- All skills developed here are **global skills** available across all projects
- Installation scripts handle the symlinking to home directory

When documenting or updating skills in this project, always refer to them as **global skills** that work system-wide, not project-specific skills.
